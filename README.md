## NHANES Health Survey Data Analysis of BMI
In this analysis, I am analyzing survey data of 20,000 people sampled from the United States to explore health behaviors associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI), a standardized measure of healthy weight and obesity.

## Research Questions
- What is the association between physical activity and BMI among people in the United States?
- What is the impact of race on BMI ranges?
- Is smoking a confounding factor to BMI ranges?

## Dataset
This analysis uses the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)] (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) data from ~20,000 participants surveyed in years 2009-2012 found in the [NHANES R package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/NHANES/versions/2.1.0/topics/NHANES).

## Research Methods
Multiple and logistic regression in R
