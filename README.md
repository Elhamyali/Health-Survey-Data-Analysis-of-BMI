## NHANES Health Survey Data Analysis of BMI
In this analysis, I am analyzing survey data of 20,000 people sampled from the United States to explore health behaviors associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI), a standardized measure of healthy weight and obesity.

## Research Questions
- What is the association between physical activity and BMI among people in the United States?
- What is the impact of race on BMI ranges?
- Is smoking a confounding factor to BMI ranges?

## Dataset
This analysis uses the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) [(NHANES)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) data from ~20,000 participants surveyed in years 2009-2012 found in the [NHANES R package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/NHANES/versions/2.1.0/topics/NHANES).

## Research Methods
Survey weighted multiple and logistic regression in R

## Insights
1. From the below box and whisker plot on the distribution of sampling weights for each race, Whites are undersampled and have higher weights. While Black, Mexican, Hispanic people are oversampled and have lower weights since each sampled person in these minority groups represents fewer US people.
